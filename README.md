# GenerativeMusic

Generative (a.k.a. procedural) music is music created by a system, music created by algorithms. The project is inspired by some works of [Brian Eno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno). 

The app uses some fundamental music ideas to produce simple melodies. E.g., if chords are played in a key (e.g., C Major), they most probably will sound good.
